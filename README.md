# AppSumo Product Title Scraper (testtest)

A Chrome Extension designed to scrape product titles from AppSumo's browse and search pages. Users can click on product titles to save them internally within the extension. The collected list of titles can then be exported as a CSV file, aiming to streamline the initial data gathering phase of product research on AppSumo.

## Overview

The AppSumo Product Title Scraper extension enhances your product research workflow on AppSumo. It allows you to:

1.  **Identify Product Titles:** Automatically detects product titles on AppSumo's browse and search pages.
2.  **One-Click Save:** Click on any product title to save it to a list stored within the extension.
3.  **Export Data:** Export your collected list of product titles as a CSV file for further analysis or use.
4.  **Manage List:** View the count of saved titles and clear the list when needed.

This tool is perfect for users who frequently browse AppSumo and want an efficient way to gather product names without manual copy-pasting.

## Features

*   **Automatic Activation:** Activates on AppSumo product browse and search result pages.
*   **Interactive Titles:** Product titles on AppSumo pages become clickable for easy saving.
*   **Persistent Storage:** Saves unique collected product titles locally using `chrome.storage.local`.
*   **CSV Export:** Download the collected list of product titles as a CSV file.
*   **Popup UI:**
    *   Displays the count of saved titles.
    *   Provides "Export to CSV" and "Clear Titles" buttons.
    *   Includes a notification area for status updates (e.g., export success, errors).
*   **Visual Feedback:**
    *   On AppSumo pages: Visual cues when a title is clicked (processing) and saved (confirmation).
    *   In Popup: Notifications for actions like export success/failure, data cleared.
*   **Centralized Configuration:** Uses `constants.js` for DOM selectors, storage keys, etc., for easier maintenance.
*   **Error Logging:** Consistent error logging via `errorlogger.js` for debugging.

## Architecture

The extension is built using Chrome's Manifest V3 architecture and consists of the following main parts:

1.  **Content Script (`appsumocontentscript.js`):**
    *   Injects into AppSumo pages.
    *   Identifies product titles using selectors from `constants.js`.
    *   Makes titles interactive (styling via `contentstyles.css`) and provides save feedback.
    *   Captures title text on click and sends it to the background service worker.

2.  **Background Service Worker (`backgroundcoordinator.js`):**
    *   The central hub for logic and data management.
    *   Listens for messages from content and popup scripts.
    *   Manages data storage operations via `titlestoragemanager.js`.
    *   Formats data for export using `csvformatter.js`.
    *   Initiates CSV downloads with `filedownloader.js`.
    *   Communicates status updates or errors to the popup.

3.  **Browser Action Popup (`popupinterface.html`, `popup.js`, `popupstyles.css`):**
    *   The user interface, accessible by clicking the extension icon.
    *   Displays saved title count.
    *   Provides "Export CSV" and "Clear Titles" buttons.
    *   Shows notifications for user feedback.
    *   Communicates user actions to the background service worker.

4.  **Utility Modules:**
    *   `constants.js`: Centralizes application-wide constants.
    *   `errorlogger.js`: Provides a consistent error logging mechanism.
    *   `titlestoragemanager.js`: Manages interactions with `chrome.storage.local`.
    *   `csvformatter.js`: Formats data into CSV.
    *   `filedownloader.js`: Handles file download logic.

## Key Configurations (`manifest.json`)

The `manifest.json` file is crucial for the extension's operation. Here's a summary of its key configurations:

```json
// manifest.json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "AppSumo Product Title Scraper",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Easily collect product titles from AppSumo browse pages and export them as a CSV file.",
  "permissions": [
    "storage",      // To store collected titles
    "downloads"     // To enable CSV export
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "*://*.appsumo.com/*" // To access and modify AppSumo pages
  ],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "backgroundcoordinator.js", // Path to the background script
    "type": "module"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": [ // URLs where the content script will be injected
        "*://*.appsumo.com/browse/*",
        "*://*.appsumo.com/categories/*",
        "*://*.appsumo.com/search*",
        "*://*.appsumo.com/plus-exclusives/*",
        "*://*.appsumo.com/collections/*"
        // Other relevant AppSumo paths where products are listed
      ],
      "js": ["appsumocontentscript.js"], // Path to the content script
      "css": ["contentstyles.css"]      // CSS for content script modifications
    }
  ],
  "action": { // Defines the browser action (toolbar icon and popup)
    "default_popup": "popupinterface.html", // HTML file for the popup
    "default_title": "AppSumo Title Scraper"
    // "default_icon": { ... } // Icon paths (not specified in current project details)
  }
}
```

## Dependencies

*   **Google Chrome Browser:** This extension is built for Google Chrome and relies on its WebExtensions API.
*   **Chrome Extension APIs:**
    *   `chrome.storage`: For persisting collected product titles.
    *   `chrome.downloads`: For enabling the CSV export functionality.
    *   `chrome.runtime`: For messaging between components (content script, background, popup).
    *   `chrome.action`: For managing the browser action (toolbar icon and popup).

## Important Notes

*   **AppSumo Website Changes:** The extension relies on specific DOM selectors to identify product titles on AppSumo pages. If AppSumo changes its website structure, these selectors (defined in `constants.js`) may need to be updated for the extension to continue working correctly. The extension includes an `errorlogger.js` to help debug such issues. Consider guiding users on how to report or check for selector issues in future versions.
*   **Manifest V3:** This extension is built using Manifest V3, the latest version of the Chrome extension platform.
*   **Data Privacy:** All data (collected product titles) is stored locally in your browser's storage and is not transmitted externally, except when you explicitly export it as a CSV file to your own computer.
